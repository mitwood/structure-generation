### SimpleGradient_BCC
Uses the moments of ACE descriptor distributions to construct the loss function used by LAMMPS.
Energy (loss) minimization is performed by LAMMPS taking a defective BCC structure back to BCC.

### EntropyMaximizing
Constructs a loss function based on the information entropy of descriptors contained within a structure.
This loss function (energy) is used by LAMMPS to find structures that maximize the internal information entropy.
